# CHeaderParser
A .NET library, with an accompanying GUI application, that will parse and extract all structures, unions and typedef information from pre-processed C header files.   The CHeaderParser library provides all the tools that are needed to create your own GUI or console based application using the classes and functions provided in the CHeaderPraser .NET dlls.   The application can also export structure/union queries into JSON formatted files which can be consumed by web applications.  A web application project has also been included that can be used to view the exported structure/union data in either a locally hosted web page or a web page hosted on a web server.
